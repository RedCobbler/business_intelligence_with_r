# Appendix 3: `.R` file for Chapter 9 Shiny app example

Below is the full code used to build the risk assessment Shiny app in *Chapter 9*. When I create R code that will be used by a lot of analysts, I use a *lot* more whitespace. Again, use whatever standards you think are appropriate; I find that sharing code that many eyes will see is much nicer on those eyes when it's easy to see what each piece is doing.
